Make BiteSprite logo. Bitten off sprite? Omnom

BMP bitmask information currently broken and simply not used. 32bit ARGB mask is assumed

Use an FBO to simulate lower resolutions. Could call it pixel size or what ever.
Also an option of turning it off so that it writes directly to context buffer.

FBO can also be used for mouse click lookup. Let the user give sprites IDs that are drawn out in one of the FBO layers, which can then be queried.

Have an alpha buffer that can be read from the shader to blend transparency independently of z-depth order.
May also work with just using the BlendFuncSeparate, dunno

x- Delete specific sprites and templates

Switch between integer and float modes. Pixel vs Subsampling!

x - Synchronization with the GL buffers so that not all data has to be uploaded each time.

x - Color key uniform for the spritesheet batch.

Animation class holding intervals and sprites

Synch fragmentation may cause worse performance than full buffer update, due to multiple function calls. Worth testing to see if it's possible to detect synch fragmentation and set a threshold to go full update instead.

Palette formats that are kept in buffer for on the fly switching in the shader. OpenGL3.3 doesn't seem to support this anymore, so it will be implemented by the shader.

x - Sprite rotation!
