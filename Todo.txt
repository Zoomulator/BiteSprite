Make BiteSprite logo. Bitten off sprite? Omnom

BMP bitmask information currently broken and simply not used. 32bit ARGB mask is assumed

Use an FBO to simulate lower resolutions. Could call it pixel size or what ever.
Also an option of turning it off so that it writes directly to context buffer.

Have an alpha buffer that can be read from the shader to blend transparency independently of z-depth order.
May also work with just using the BlendFuncSeparate, dunno
